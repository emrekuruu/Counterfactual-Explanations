306,"For the crepe recipe; First, whisk the eggs and milk in a bowl. Then add the flour, baking powder, oil and salt and continue whisking. The consistency should not be too fluid or too solid. If it's too runny, you can add a little more flour to solidify it. For cooking, you can use a medium or large skillet as desired. Once the pan is hot, drop a drop of oil into it, then take a soup ladle of pancakes from the pan and spread them on the pan. Wait for it to cook very little on medium heat and turn it over with the help of tongs. To prevent it from sticking, put a drop of oil on the bottom of the pan, leaking it from the side of the pan.

309,"To start applying the cinnamon chocolate cake recipe, you can start adding other ingredients after you wait for the margarine to melt. After whisking the sugar with the margarine, add the 5 egg yolks one by one to the mixture. Add chocolate chips to the milk you have heated in a coffee pot and take it off the stove without allowing it to overheat. After adding the chocolate milk to the liquid mixture, add the flour you mixed in a different bowl (don't forget to sift it for airiness and better rise), lemon peel, baking powder, cinnamon mixture. Mix for a while with the help of a wooden spoon, without allowing the dough to become heavy. With the help of a clean mixer tip, start whisking the egg whites that you separated the yolks by adding the salt. After a while, you will see that it has a foamy consistency. Add it to the main mixture after whisking until you are sure that the whipped cream will not remain in liquid form at the bottom of the bowl. You can cause bubbles to form in the mixture by quickly turning the wooden spoon from the bottom up. In this way, the dough will rise well without getting heavy. After transferring the mixture to the bowl you have oiled, the cake mixture is ready to be placed in the preheated 180 degree oven. After 35 minutes, you can check if the cake is cooked by inserting a knife into the fluffiest part of the cake (the chocolate melted in milk will give you a slightly moist cake).

344,"When making raw meatballs with potatoes, first, to prepare ground beef with olive oil, mince and olive oil are put in a pan and roasted on low heat. Onion is chopped and added to it. The lid is closed, and it is cooked on low heat until the onion juice is released and absorbed. Add salt, black pepper, chili flakes and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add chopped parsley and mix. It is taken from the stove. Now that the ground beef is ready, we can move on to preparing the meatballs. Boiled potatoes are grated. Finely chop the onion, garlic and parsley. Meatballs are soaked with bulgur. Spices, half of the grated potato, tomato paste are put in a mixing bowl. First, onions, garlic, tomato paste and spices are mixed. Mix the bulgur with potatoes and start kneading. Added pomegranate molasses. It is kneaded like raw meatballs, but don't be intimidated. The remaining potato is finished by adding it as it dries (2-3 times). When the meatballs soften and get thick, add chopped parsley and olive oil. Mix well, serve. Let me explain for those who don't know. You may say, what does roasting meatballs and ground beef have to do with it? Our meatballs are eaten by dipping them in this olive oil minced meat. Potato Meatballs are indispensable in Hatay. Tip: Potatoes must be freshly boiled. The potato you boiled 1 day ago prevents the meatballs from getting consistency, and the taste will not be good. While soaking the bulgur, the water should be cold and kneaded without waiting for a long time. Raw meatballs with potatoes are ready to be served.

350,"To make stuffed mussels, first scrape the shells of the mussels you bought and wash them thoroughly and remove the broken or dead mussels. Boil the mussels in this water by adding 1 teaspoon of salt to 1 liter of water. As soon as the mussels open, take them off the stove and put them in a bowl. If there are any mussels that haven't opened, separate them as well. Let the boiling water cool down. To prepare the stuffed pilaf, fry the finely chopped onions in olive oil. Add the grated garlic and peanuts and continue frying. Then add rice and other spices respectively. Take two glasses of the mussel boiling water that you have left to cool, add it to the mixture and cook it on low heat until it absorbs its water. At this stage, the rice will remain somewhat firm. Fill the mussels with the stuffed rice and put them in a deep pot vertically. Add the remaining 2 glasses of water from the boiling water and 2 extra glasses of water and cook for another 20 minutes on medium heat. You can serve it with lemons cut into circles. Stuffed mussels are ready to serve.

828,"For the Olive Oil Chard Wrap recipe; Wash the chard leaves with plenty of water and cut the stems and put them in a separate place. (You can roast the chard stalks as a separate dish) Put a pot of water on the stove and bring it to a boil.

Repeat the same process until the chard leaves are gone and put all the chard in the strainer and let it cool. While the leaves are cooling, to prepare the inside of the chard wrap, wash the rice and pour it into a separate pot. Stir with a wooden spoon over medium heat for 1-2 minutes until the rice is dry. Add 1 tea glass of olive oil, spices and tomato paste on top. Stir for about 3-4 minutes on low heat on the stove. Finely chop the garlic and onion, add the walnut and pepper paste on top and mix for another 2-3 minutes. Cover the mixture before it cooks too much. At this stage, stir from time to time so that the bottom does not stick and let it cool. If the chard leaves are large, cut them in half and fill them with mortar and wrap them. After the wrapping work is finished, put the remaining veins and stems from the chard at the bottom of the pot. Knee the wraps and add 2 cups of water on top. Lay a flat plate on top of the last wraps. Cook for 30 minutes on medium heat.

836,"To prepare profiteroles; Put 1 glass of water and margarine in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Then add 1 cup of flour and mix well. Cook the mixture for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. Turn off the stove and wait 10-15 minutes for the dough to cool. After the dough has rested for a while, beat 3 eggs into the dough. However, break the eggs into the dough one by one and do not break the other egg until one is well fed. Mix well so that the dough rises. After the eggs are eaten, rest the dough for 10 minutes. With the help of a spoon, take walnut-sized pieces of dough and pour them into the greased tray, paying attention to the 2-3 cm gap between them, as in the picture. Put the dough in the oven, which we previously heated at 180 degrees. Bake for about 40 minutes until golden brown. After the dough is cooked, prepare the cream. Cook the milk, sugar, 3 tablespoons of flour and 1 egg in a saucepan until it reaches a creamy consistency, then add the vanilla and mix. Divide the cooked dough of profiteroles into two or fill them with cream using a cream squeezing bag, if any, and place them on the tray. After filling all the profiteroles, pour the chocolate you melted in a bain-marie. Note: This is how you melt the bain-marie chocolate.

We put the butter, oil, yoghurt and egg that we will use to make the almond paste into the mixing bowl and mix it in such a way that it mixes well. Then we add the powdered sugar. Then we add the semolina and continue mixing. Add 100gr of ground almonds and baking powder to this mixture and mix them well. By adding the flour little by little, we knead it so that it will not be hard (to a consistency that can take shape). We take the walnut-sized dough in our hands, roll it, press it lightly and arrange it on the greased tray. We apply the egg yolk, which we call five tablespoons, on the almond pieces that we put on the tray and dip an almond in each. We bake in a preheated oven at 170 degrees until golden brown. 5 minutes after taking the almonds out of the oven, we pour the syrup on them, which we left to cool. Then we turn a tray on it and wait until it cools down. Badempare is ready to serve.

When the yeast rises, add 1 glass of oil, milk, granulated sugar, salt and flour as much as it takes and knead until it reaches the consistency of an earlobe. Then leave the dough to ferment. Melt the butter, add 1 tea glass of oil to it and let it cool. Meanwhile, grind the walnuts. Make sure it is neither too big nor too small. In the meantime, separate the fermented dough into small balls, roll them and put them on the tray. Cover it and wait for it to ferment a little more. Flour the meringues one by one and open them thinly. Spread about 3 spoons of oil mixture on the dough and spread it with the help of a brush to feed it all over. Roll out a sheet of dough on it again and apply oil. Do the same at the top. Cut the dough into strips, with 3 layers of dough, oiled between and on top, at the level of 4 fingers on top of the knee. Roll the strips you cut by wrapping them with your four fingers without squeezing them. Glue the gold with your hand so that it does not spill out because you are going to put walnuts on it. For each flake, add the walnut kernels with the tip of the tablespoon and cover with a slight puckering. After applying the same process to all the strips one by one, put them on the tray. Cover the tray with a cloth so that it does not dry out and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.

1624,"For the Mustard Pistachio Chops recipe, we salt and black pepper the cutlets and first seal them in a pan without oil (no oil was used because it has its own oil). We seal it on high heat for about 1-2 minutes until both sides are browned (by frying the outside of the meat, we ensure that the water inside is trapped). After the sealing process, we apply mustard on one side and sprinkle pistachios on them. We put it on the baking tray and bake for another 5 minutes at 180 degrees. For the salad, we mix all the ingredients and add the lemon and salt. Mustard Pistachio Chops are ready to serve.

1653,"For the Whole Wheat Bread recipe; Yeast and sugar are mixed, warm water is added into it and the resulting mixture is left for 5 minutes. The flour and salt are taken into the mixer and the yeast is added and whisked. Water is slowly added to the mixture and when it reaches the consistency of dough, it is kneaded a little more, covered with cling film and left to rest in a warm environment for 40 minutes. The dough that has risen is given its final shape by flouring it and removing its air. It is placed on a baking tray and, after resting for another 20 minutes, it is first baked at 190 degrees for 15 minutes, then at 180 degrees for 15 minutes in the fan option. After the bread is taken out of the oven, it is expected to cool before cutting it so that it does not become doughy. Note: Salt is never added to the yeast because salt kills the yeast and sugar makes the bread rise better. Whole Wheat Bread is ready to serve.

Be careful to turn it over carefully using a soft spatula because the banana mix can get sticky if you're not gentle.
